# Weather App 🌦️  

A simple and intuitive weather app that fetches real-time weather data from an API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) and displays dynamic icons based on the current weather conditions. This project is part of my learning journey in API integration and frontend development.  

## Features 🚀  
- Fetches **real-time weather data** from a public API  
- Displays **dynamic icons** matching current weather conditions  
- Clean and minimal design for easy use  

## Technologies Used 🛠  
- **HTML, CSS** – Structure and styling  
- **JavaScript** – Fetching data from the API and dynamically updating the UI  
- **Weather API** – OpenWeatherMap or similar for real-time data  

## Roadmap & Future Improvements 🏗  
- Add support for **user location detection**  
- Implement a **search function** for different cities  
- Display **extended forecasts** for multiple days  
- Improve **responsive design** for mobile and tablet devices
